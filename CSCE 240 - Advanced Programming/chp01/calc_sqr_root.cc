/* The Babylonian square root calculation of a value n, algorithm works as
 * follows:
 * 1.) Guess at the correct square root (n/2 maybe?)
 * 2.) Calculate root = n / guess
 * 3.) Let guess = (guess + r)/2
 * 4.) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the square root is resolved.
 *
 * Implement the above algorithm and repeat steps 2 and 3 five times. Copy/pasta
 * is your friend here.
